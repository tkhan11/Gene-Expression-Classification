# The 7129 gene descriptions are provided as the rows and the values for each patient as the columns. This will clearly require some tidying up.
# 
# Our first decision is: What should we do about all the "call" columns, one for each patient. No explanation for these is provided, so it's difficult to know whether they might be useful or not. We have taken the decision to simply remove them, but this may possibly not be the best approach. 

# Transform all the call values to numbers (not used in this version)

# That looks much better. We have the 38 patients as rows in the training set, and the other 34 as rows in the testing set. Each of those datasets has 7129 gene expression features.
# 
# But we haven't yet associated the target labels with the right patients. You will recall that all the labels are all stored in a single dataframe. Let's split the data so that the patients and labels match up across the training and testing dataframes.
# Split into train and test (we first need to reset the index as the indexes of two dataframes need to be the same before you combine them).

# Subset the first 38 patient's cancer types

# Let's now take a look at some summary statistics:
X_train.describe()


# Clearly there is some variation in the scales across the different features. Many machine learning models work much better with data that's on the same scale, so let's create a scaled version of the dataset.
# Convert from integer to float
X_train_fl = X_train.astype(float, 64)
X_test_fl = X_test.astype(float, 64)

# Apply the same scaling to both datasets
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scl = scaler.fit_transform(X_train_fl)
X_test_scl = scaler.transform(X_test_fl) # note that we transform rather than fit_transform


# With 7129 features, it's also worth considering whether we might be able to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. Once very common approach to this is principal components analysis (PCA). Let's start by leaving the number of desired components as an open question: 
pca = PCA()
pca.fit_transform(X_train)


# Let's set a threshold for explained variance of 90% and see how many features are required to meet that threshold. (Here we are using the code from [this kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/rstogi896/geneclassification-using-gridsearchcv-and-svm).)

# ## Model Building

# Having prepared the dataset, it's now finally time to try out some models. 


# Let's start by establishing a naive baseline. This doesn't require a model, we are just taking the proportion of tests that belong to the majority class as a baseline. In other words, let's see what happens if we were to predict that every patient belongs to the "ALL" class.

# ### Neural Network

#we shall build a neural network using Keras (with TensorFlow as a backend). This only a "shallow" learning model with one hidden layer â€” adding several extra layers with so few training datapoints would just lead to overfitting.  

# Create model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(7129,)))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
loss='binary_crossentropy',
metrics=['accuracy'])

# Create training/validation sets

X_val = X_train_scl[30:]

y_val = y_train_label[30:]

# Set up early stopping
es = EarlyStopping(monitor='val_loss', verbose=1, patience=3)

# Fit model
history = model.fit(partial_X_train,
            partial_y_train,
            epochs=50,
            batch_size=4,
            validation_data=(X_val, y_val),
            callbacks=[es])

# Make predictions
nn_pred = model.predict_classes(X_test_scl)

print('Neural Network accuracy: ', round(accuracy_score(y_test.iloc[:,1], nn_pred), 3))

cm_nn = confusion_matrix(y_test.iloc[:,1], nn_pred)
